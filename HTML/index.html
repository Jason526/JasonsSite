              There was something special about this little creature. Donna
              couldn't quite pinpoint what it was, but she knew with all her
              heart that it was true. It wasn't a matter of if she was going to
              try and save it, but a matter of how she was going to save it. She
              went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the
              creature was gone.
